# MakeItBetter
A repo where you make the choice

Please take this code and make it better. How you do that is up to you.

Originally this code was written to work out how data was handled on a low powered connected TV device. The implementation of the browser on that device could only take ES5 code. Instead of using Babel to convert modern JS, it was just written in ES5. We frequently deal with different browser restrictions, under powered devices and levels of HTML, JS and CSS support.

To make this code better you can convert it to Typescript, convert it to React, do both? Make it modern and make sure it runs. Keep it simple.

Clone this repo, create a branch from main, make your changes and submit a PR. Please leave a description of what was changed and why.
